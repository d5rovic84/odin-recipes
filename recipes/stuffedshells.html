            <h2>Stuffed Shells</h2>
            Jumbo stuffed shells filled with three types of cheese are topped with a savory tomato sauce in this family-friendly pasta dish that'll have everyone coming back for seconds! These stuffed shells are easy-to-make and always guaranteed to be a hit. This rich and cheesy comfort-food meal looks like a deep-dish pizza when it's done. I altered what I was originally given because I did not like cottage cheese and added other ingredients that I thought it deserved.
