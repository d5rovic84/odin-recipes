# odin-recipes

Odin lessons: Foundations-Project:Reipes
Create a new repo for this project on GitHub.com and call it odin-recipes.
Move that repository onto your local machine, inside the repos folder that you previously created in the Git Basics lesson. The command should look like git clone git@github.com:username/odin-recipes.git (use SSH).
Now cd into the odin-recipes project directory that is now on your local machine.
Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)
